                <h2>Session 1 - Chance Encounter</h2>
                <p>Under the azure sky of Sylvora, the brave and determined Caelynn set forth on a noble quest. Her destination was the trading post of Hammerfel, to deliver much-needed supplies. This mission aligned well with her personal quest to the northern village of Phandalin, where an old friend had summoned her.</p>
                
                <p>As she journeyed through the enchanting landscape of the Sgadefall Glades, the scene was breathtaking. The dark brown grass, kissed by twilight, swayed gently in the wind, while the many rivers meandered through the glades like gleaming serpents. The tranquillity and beauty of the glades enveloped her, a stark contrast to the turmoil she would soon face.</p>
                
                <p>With nightfall encroaching, Caelynn wisely decided to veer off the beaten path, seeking a safe haven to rest. She discovered a snug spot, shielded by nature’s embrace, where her horse and carriage could find respite. As she settled in and attempted to drift into slumber, her keen senses (a gift from the gods, no doubt) detected a subtle rustling in the nearby trees, accompanied by hushed voices.</p>    
                
                <p>Driven by curiosity and caution, Caelynn stealthily approached the source of the disturbance. Utilizing the shadows and the natural cover, she crept closer, peering upwards only to spot two goblins perched in the branches, squabbling over their malicious plans to rob her. With practiced precision, Caelynn summoned her favored cantrip, Thorn Whip. The magical vine lashed out, ensnaring one goblin and hurling it from the tree with a startled yelp.</p>
                
                <p>Seizing the moment, Caelynn launched into combat, swiftly dispatching the grounded goblin. The second goblin, perched high and armed with a slingshot, retaliated with a barrage of stones. Amid the fray, a third goblin, previously unseen, struck Caelynn with an arrow from its hidden vantage point, laughing cruelly at its marksmanship.</p>
                
                <p>Undeterred, Caelynn fought valiantly. Despite the relentless assault from the slingshot, she managed to defeat her foes, her wounds aching with each movement. With the battle won, she applied her healing magic to mend her injuries. Just as she began to catch her breath, faint mumblings emanated from a nearby bush.</p>
                
                <p>Investigating cautiously, she discovered an unconscious half-orc, grievously wounded and barely clinging to life. Her heart moved by compassion, Caelynn used her knowledge of the wilderness to fashion makeshift bandages, staunching the flow of blood. The effort to drag the towering half-orc, who stood six feet tall and weighed nearly 190 pounds, was considerable, but she managed to bring him back to her cart and made a comfortable bed for him.</p>
                
                <p>As dawn broke, the half-orc remained unconscious, occasionally murmuring in his sleep. Determined not to abandon him, Caelynn helped the injured stranger onto her cart and continued her journey towards Hammerfel, the rising sun casting a hopeful light on the road ahead.</p>

                <h2>Session 2 - Arriving in Hammerfel</h2>
                <p>As dawn broke over the Dragonreach Highlands, Caelynn continued her journey to Hammerfel, the sun casting its golden rays over verdant fields and distant, towering mountains. The grass was a lush green, and far on the horizon, she could discern the faint edges of the Emberfalls crater, a testament to the land’s fiery past. Her mission was clear: deliver the supplies to the Traveller's Rest Inn and find Grondo Copperback.</p>

                <p>The journey was uneventful, almost suspiciously serene, as if the fates themselves were granting her passage without hindrance. Caelynn enjoyed the calm, her silver-white hair catching the sunlight, the warmth of the day invigorating her spirit. However, her peace was intermittently disturbed by noises from the back of her cart—crates shifting more than they should, but upon investigation, she found nothing amiss. Perhaps it was just the wind, or the half-orc occasionally stirring in his slumber.</p>

                <p>Approaching Hammerfel, the smoke from the bustling trading post signaled her proximity. As she neared the gates, Caelynn noticed the guards were different from those she had encountered before—better armored and armed. When asked for her name, Caelynn realized that as an emergency replacement for the delivery, her name hadn’t reached the gatekeepers. They demanded a steep tourist fee of 25 gold for two nights, which included accommodations and breakfast.</p>

                <p>Caelynn’s attempts to persuade and intimidate the guards were futile. Faced with a tough decision, she couldn’t afford to pay for her injured companion. Resolutely, she turned to wake the half-orc, only to find him suddenly alert and surprisingly mobile. "Yeah, yeah, I get it," he muttered, slipping off the cart. Perhaps she had been tricked into providing a free ride, but there was no time to dwell on it.</p>

                <p>Paying the fee, Caelynn entered Hammerfel, drawn immediately to the lively marketplace on one side and the large building bearing the name "Traveller's Rest Inn" in copper letters on the other. Inside, the air was filled with the aroma of spiced meats and the sound of a soft piano melody. She stabled her horse, though the stable boy demanded gold with a veiled threat to sell the horse if she didn’t return promptly.</p>

                <p>Rushing into the inn, Caelynn kicked the door open and called out for Grondo, causing quite a stir. A drunkard tried to start trouble, but Caelynn defused the situation by promising drinks for his table. At the bar, she finally met Grondo, a short, wavy-haired gnome who owned the inn with his mother, Grinda. After some discussion, Grondo agreed to pay her 50 gold for the delivery and to reimburse her entry fee.</p>

                <p>They proceeded to the stables to check the supplies. Caelynn mentioned the stable boy’s extortion, which Grondo rectified by demanding the boy return the gold. As Grondo inspected the supplies, he noticed some meat and ale missing. Caelynn realized that the half-orc must have been pilfering the supplies during the journey. Fortunately, it wasn’t a significant loss, and Grondo only deducted 5 gold.</p>

                <p>Back at the inn, Caelynn enjoyed a meal and conversed with Grondo. He shared stories about Hammerfel and offered her a position as a regular supplier, which she declined but promised to consider in the future. As night fell, she retired to her room, cleaning the goblin blood from her boots and mending her torn clothes.</p>

                <p>Just as she was about to sleep... there was a knocking and the familiar voice of Grinda, grondos mom came from outside the door. she let her in, and Grinda grabbed the chair from the corner of the room and sat down, her eyes had less energy in them as fear covered her face, and said "Caelynn, you're tough, and you seem like a good person. I have a job... a favour to ask... Grondo and I are in danger."</p>
